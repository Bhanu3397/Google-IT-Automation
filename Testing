What is automated testing?
Automated testing uses software to execute your code and compare the actual results with the results you expect.
Compare this with exploratory or manual testing, where a human typically follows instructions in a test plan to verify that software functions as expected.
Manual testing has its benefits. But as your code base grows in size, testing all features manually (including edge cases) can become repetitive, tedious, and error prone.
Automated testing can help eliminate some of this burden and enable manual testers to focus on what they do best: ensuring that your users will have a positive experience with your software.

The test pyramid
When we think about automated testing, it's common to separate tests into layers. Mike Cohn proposes this concept, known as the test pyramid, in his book Succeeding with Agile.
