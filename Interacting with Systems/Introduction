""Kernel - The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our systems resources. 
As users, we don't interact with the kernel directly. 
Instead, we interact with the other part of the operating system called the user space. 
The User space is basically everything outside of the kernel. 
These are things that we interact with directly, like the system programs and user interface ""

""PyPi - Python package index"" Managed by pip.

#!/usr/bin/env python3("Inserting a shebang line (such as #!/usr/bin/env python3) as the first line tells the operating system what command we want to use to execute the script.")

chmod +x to set file as a executable

"./" represents current directory

modules are helpful when you are reusing the same code in more than one location. So updating in single location is enough to update whereever the modules is used.
"We use the import command to import any module located in the PATH directory. We can also use import as to assign a localName variable to the imported module."

IDEs - Integrated development environment

A compiled language is translated into code readable by the target machine during development using a compiler.

Code completion is an IDE feature that takes educated guesses about what you might be trying to type next, and offers suggestions to complete it for you.

The PATH variable tells the operating system where to find executables.

" [time_to_automate < (time_to_perform * amount_of_times_done)"

"Forensic value, in relation to automation, is the value we get while debugging from properly logging every action our automation scripts take."

"A virtual machine, or VM, is a computer simulated through software. It simulates all the necessary hardware to the operating system that's running inside the machine."
