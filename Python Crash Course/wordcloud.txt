Every one acquainted   manners  customs   East must 
aware  there  no situation  eminence more unstable, or more
dangerous  its possessor, than    pacha.  Nothing, perhaps,
affords us more convincing proof   risk which men will incur, 
obtain  temporary authority over their fellow-creatures, than 
avidity  which this office  accepted from  sultan who, within
 memory   new occupant, has consigned scores   predecessors
  bow-string.   would almost appear,  if  despot 
elevated  head from  crowd,   might obtain  more fair 
uninterrupted sweep   scimitar, when  cut  off; only exceeded

these observations,   may   accused   disregard

such ephemeral creations,  will  quite sufficient  say, "There

Would you inquire  what means   raised   distinction?   
an idle question.   this world, pre-eminence over your fellow

honours are bequeathed,    good, or  evil deeds, or 
talents  which they were obtained.    latter we    life

varieties   necessary   well binding  society,   divers

appointed him   vacant pachalik.   qualifications  office
were all superlative:    short,  corpulent, 
illiterate,  irascible,   stupid.

  morning after  investment,   under  hands

privileged persons  many reasons: running from one employer

Mustapha   Greek  birth,  inherited all  intelligence

slave;  at  age  nineteen  accompanied  master  board

Mahomet; then quitting  scene   apostacy, recommenced 
profession  barber   territory   pacha; whose good-will 
had obtained previous   latter's advancement   pachalik.

"Mustapha," observed  pacha, "thou knowest    taken off 
heads  all those who left their slippers at  door   late
pacha."

"Allah Kebur!  God  most powerful!  So perish  enemies  your
sublime highness.  Were they   sons  Shitan?" replied Mustapha.

" true; , Mustapha,  consequence    am  want  
vizier;  whom do  know equal   office?"

"While your sublime highness  pacha,    child equal  
office?  Who stumbles, when guided  unerring wisdom?"

" know   well," replied  pacha; " if  am always 
direct him,  might  well  vizier myself; besides,  shall  no
one  blame, if affairs  wrong   sultan.  Inshallah! please
 Lord,  vizier's head may sometimes save my own."

"Are we   dogs before you?" replied Mustapha: "happy  man, who
 offering  own head may preserve   your sublime highness!  
ought    proudest day   life."

"At all events  would   last," rejoined  pacha.

"May  please your sublime highness," observed Mustapha, after  pause,
"if your slave may  so honoured   speak  your presence,  vizier
should   person  great tact;  should  able  draw  line 
nicely   do when  shave your sublime head, leaving   vestige 
 hair, yet entering  upon  skin."

" true, Mustapha."

" should   sharp eye   disaffected   government,
selecting them  removing them from among  crowd,   do  few
white hairs which presume  make their appearance  your sublime 
magnificent beard."

" true, Mustapha."

" should carefully remove all impurities from  state,   
this morning from your sublime ears."

" true, Mustapha."

" should  well acquainted   secret springs  action,  
 proved myself     shampooing which your sublime highness
has just received."

" true, Mustapha."

"Moreover,  should  ever grateful  your highness  
distinguished honour conferred upon him."

"All  you say   true, Mustapha,  where am   meet 
such  man?"

"This world  convenient  some points," continued Mustapha; "if you
want either  fool or  knave, you   far    find them; 
  no easy task  select  person you require.   know  one."

" who  ?"

"One whose head    your footstool," answered  barber,
prostrating himself,--"your sublime highness's most devoted slave,
Mustapha."

"Holy Prophet!  Then you mean yourself!--Well,   think  , if one
barber can become  pacha,  do  see why another would  make 
vizier.   then what am   do   barber?  No, no, Mustapha; 
good vizier  easy   found,   good barber, you know  well 
 do, requires some talent."

"Your slave  aware  ," replied Mustapha, "  has travelled
 other countries, where   no uncommon circumstance  men  hold
more than one office under government; sometimes much more incompatible
than those  barber  vizier, which are indeed closely connected.
 affairs  most nations are settled   potentates during their
toilet.  While  am shaving  head  your sublime highness,  can
receive your commands  take off  heads  others;  you can 
your person  your state both put  order at  same moment."

" true, Mustapha; then,  condition  you continue your office
 barber,   no objection  throw   vizier into 
bargain."

Mustapha again prostrated himself,   tweezers   hand.  
then rose,  continued  office.

"You can write, Mustapha," observed  pacha, after  short silence.

"Min Allah!  God forbid   should acknowledge , or  should
consider myself  unfit  assume  office  which your sublime
highness has invested me."

"Although unnecessary  me,  thought  might  requisite  
vizier," observed  pacha.

"Reading may  necessary,  will allow," replied Mustapha; "  trust
 can soon prove  your highness  writing   dangerous   
useless.  More men  been ruined   unfortunate acquirement,
than  any other;  dangerous     all,   still more
dangerous  men  high power.   instance, your sublime highness
sends  message  writing, which  ill-received,    produced
against you;  had  been  verbal message, you could deny , 
bastinado  death  Tartar who carried ,   proof  your
sincerity."

" true, Mustapha."

" grandfather  your slave," continued  barber-vizier, "held 
situation  receiver-general at  custom-house;    always 
 fury when   obliged  take up  pen.     creed, 
no government could prosper when writing   general use.  `Observe,
Mustapha,' said   me one day, `here   curse  writing,--
all  money which  paid ,  am obliged  give  receipt.  What 
 consequence?  government loses many thousand sequins every year;
 when  apply  them   second payment, they produce their
receipt.   if  had  been  this cursed invention  writing,
Inshallah! they should  paid twice, if  thrice over.  Remember,
Mustapha,' continued , ` reading  writing only clog  wheels
 government.'"

" true, Mustapha," observed  pacha, "then we will  no
writing."

"Yes, your sublime highness, every thing  writing from others, 
nothing  writing from ourselves.     young Greek slave, who can
 employed  these matters.   reads well.    lately employed
him  reading  me  stories  `Thousand  one Nights.'"

"Stories," cried  pacha; "what are they about?   never heard 
them; 'm  fond  stories."

"If  would pleasure your sublime highness  hear these stories read,
 slave will wait your commands," replied  vizier.

"Bring him this evening, Mustapha; we will smoke  pipe,  listen 
them; 'm  fond  stories--they always send me  sleep."

 business   day  transacted  admirable precision 
despatch   two quondam barbers, who proved how easy   
govern, where there are  "three estates"  confuse people.  They sat
  divan  highwaymen loiter   road,    "Your money or
your life"  all who made their appearance.

At  usual hour  court broke up,  guards retired,  money 
carried   treasury,  executioner wiped  sword,   lives
  pacha's subjects were considered     state  comparative
security, until  affairs   country were again brought under
their cognisance   ensuing day.

 obedience   wish expressed   pacha, Mustapha made 
appearance   afternoon   young Greek slave.   new vizier
having taken  seat upon  cushion at  feet   pacha,  pipes
were lighted,   slave  directed  proceed.

 Greek had arrived   end   First Night,  which
Schezehezerade commences her story,   Sultan, who  anxious 
hear  termination  , defers her execution   following day.

"Stop," cried  pacha, taking  pipe from  lips; "how long before
 break  day did  girl call her sister?"

"About half an hour, your sublime highness."

"Wallah!    all  could tell  her story  half an hour?--
There's   woman  my harem who would  say  much  five
minutes."

 pacha  so amused   stories,   never once felt
inclined  sleep;   contrary,  Greek slave  compelled 
read every afternoon, until  legs were so tired   could hardly
stand,   tongue almost refused its office; consequently, they were
soon finished;  Mustapha  being able  procure any more, they
were read  second time.  After which  pacha, who felt  loss 
 evening's amusement, became first puzzled how  pass away  time;
then  changed  hypochondriacism,  finally became so irritable,
 even Mustapha himself, at times, approached him  some degree 
awe.

"  been thinking," observed  pacha, one morning, when under 
hands  Mustapha,   original capacity, "  would   easy
 me   stories told me,   caliph   Arabian Nights."

" wonder   your highness should desire .  Those stories are 
 opium  Theriarkis, filling  soul  visions  delight at 
moment,  leaving  palsied from over-excitement, when their effect
has passed away.  How does your sublime highness propose  obtain your
end;   what manner can your slave assist  produce your wishes?"

" shall manage  without assistance; come this evening  you shall
see, Mustapha."

Mustapha made  appearance   afternoon,   pacha smoked 
pipe  some time,  appeared  if communing  himself;  then
laid  down,  clapping  hands, desired one   slaves 
inform  favourite lady, Zeinab,   desired her presence.

Zeinab entered  her veil down.  "Your slave attends  pleasure 
her lord."

"Zeinab," said  pacha, "do you love me?"

"Do   worship  dust  my lord treads ?"

" true--then    favour  request: observe, Zeinab--  my
wish ,"--(here  pacha took  few whiffs from  pipe)--" fact
-- wish you  dishonour my harem  soon  possible."

"Wallah sel Nebi!!-- Allah   Prophet your highness    merry
humour this evening," replied Zeinab, turning round  quit 
apartment.

"  contrary,  am   serious humour;  mean what   said; 
 expect  you will comply  my wishes."

" my lord mad? or has  indulged too freely   juice   grape
forbidden  our Prophet?  Allah kebur!  God  most powerful-- hakim
must  sent ."

"Will you do   order you?" said  pacha angrily.

"Does my lord send   slave  insult her!  My blood   water,
at  dreadful thought!--Dishonour  harem!--Min Allah!  God
forbid!--Would   eunuch  ready   sack?"

"Yes, they would,  acknowledge;  still  must  done."

" shall   done," replied  lady:--"Has my lord been visited 
Heaven? or   possessed   Shitan?"--  lady burst into
tears  rage  vexation   quitted  apartment.
