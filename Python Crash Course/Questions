Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.
The retry function tries to execute an operation that might fail, it retries the operation for a number of attempts. Currently the code will keep executing the function even if it succeeds. Fill in the blank so the code stops trying after the operation succeeded.
Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.
